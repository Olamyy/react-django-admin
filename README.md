This project aims to implement the django-admin on the client using react-js
All the configurations just needs to be done on the api just like how django admin
works normally, Based on the convention sent from the api server, this client app renders

**NB**
This is a new project and is highly experimental. Chances are it won't be easily
customizable and would take the default look of django admin.

Contributors are welcome.
